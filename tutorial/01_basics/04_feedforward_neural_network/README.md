# Feedforward Neural Network
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) are a basic form of machine learning
that are still used in day-to-day life. This lesson focuses on the
general structure of FNNs, creating an FNN using the TensorFlow
framework, and showing its effectiveness on MNIST, a simple
classification problem for hand-drawn digits.

## Contents
1. main.py
    * An example FNN that is created, trained on MNIST training data,
     and validated using a separate MNIST testing set.
2. feedforward_neural_network.ipynb
    * A small tutorial explaining the development of the FNN model
     and an overview of the MNIST training and testing.
3. model
    * Contains a class version of the FNN instead of the script version
     for more uses, as well as an example using MNIST.
