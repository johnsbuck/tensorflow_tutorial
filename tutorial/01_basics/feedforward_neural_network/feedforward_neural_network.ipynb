    "# TensorFlow Tutorial - Feedforward Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) are one of the most simplistic models in neural networks and machine learning, but have been used to solve various problems since its creation. You can still find several uses for FNNs to this day in many different algorithms, and still acts as a great start for designing other models. In this tutorial, we will be taking apart our FNN Python Script ([feedforward_neural_network/main.py]()) in order to describe each part used in developing an efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Should Know\n",
    "For this tutorial, I suggest learning the basic, theoretical design for FNNs beforehand as it can help you grasp a better understanding when implementing. I would suggest watching [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs) by Welch Labs, as it presents a very good explanation for FNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Are We Solving?\n",
    "We will be focusing on a textbook problem for our FNN to solve, the classification of hand-drawn digits. This is primarily done using the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28-by-28 px images, for training and testing of our FNN.\n",

    "## Model Development Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, there are 5 steps in developing any model for machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data\n",
    "\t* Import and pre-process a given dataset(s) for training, testing, and possibly making predictions with our model.\n",
    "2. Model\n",
    "\t* Design and implement the model so that it can properly use the dataset.\n",
    "\t* This includes setting proper sizes for inputs and outputs based on the dataset specifications and the problem the model is used to solve.\n",
    "3. Train\n",
    "\t* Using your training dataset, train your model so that it can better fit the inputs with the outputs.\n",
    "4. Test/Evaluate\n",
    "\t* After (and optionally in between) training, use your model to predict the input of your testing dataset and compare with the actual results.\n",
    "5. Predict\n",
    "\t* Use your newly developed model for later inputs from unknown data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this tutorial, we will be focusing on the first 4 steps and go over our import of our MNIST dataset, the creation of a FNN to classify digits, and the training & testing performed to create a strong model. Before we begin, lets import TensorFlow."
